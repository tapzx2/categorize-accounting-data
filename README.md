separate.py separates accounting data into income and expense.

categorize.py uses filters and terminal to assist user in categorizing accoutning data

summarize.py (not built yet) outputs the summary needed for accountants.

## Purpose

I dread categorizing our small business expenses. So much clicking and human error. This dread motivated a python capstone project!

## Next Steps

categorize.py could use a code review.

### Small Issues

- double undo
- categorize.py, exit, categorize.py creates a second backup
- does not handle anything but wells fargo structred csv files
- categories list could be alpha sort
